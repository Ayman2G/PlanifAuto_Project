# PlanAuto

## Description

This project aims at solving a pddl problem. For this purpose, we implemented a method that uses both A* and the heuristic of FastForward. This is part of the automated planning course of CentraleSupélec.

## Structure of the repository

The repository is composed of a `main.py` to run the project, a folder `data` to store the problems and domains pddl files, a `src` folder with the parser, the graphplan part to compute the heuristic and the a_star part to run A*.


## Usage

To compute a solution of a planification problem, run the main.py file :
```
Python main.py
```
